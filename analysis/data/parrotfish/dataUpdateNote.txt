Hi Ian,

Attached are the two updated Atlantic files. I made changes to the site names based on the photo you sent me (specific changes listed below). Since I'm not sure what changes you made (if any) to the naming scheme of the Pacific data file, I recommend just using the version you already have and just deleting the 'species' column since that was the only change I made. Other than that, please let me know if there is anything more I can do. 

           Cheers,
            John
